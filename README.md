# BallGame

## Setup Steps

### Repo Setup

The repo has been created using [nx.dev](https://nx.dev/) using react, vite and no framework in standalone mode.

You can start the app by running:
```bash
npx nx serve ball-game
```

### Dependencies

1. `three` is the core library and `@types/three` provides typescript support
2. `@react-three/fiber` is the react reconciler for threejs (similar to `react-dom` but for 3D/threejs instead of HTML)
3. `@react-three/drei` not required, but has a lot of handy ThreeJS react components
4. `@react-three/rapier` provides physics. Other physics engines are available.
5. `leva` is used to alter components directly in the scene to experiment quickly

```bash
yarn add three @types/three @react-three/fiber @react-three/drei @react-three/rapier
```

### Other Resources

1. [manyworld.run](https://www.manyworlds.run/) is used to generate the "sky" (space background).

## Generate code

If you happen to use Nx plugins, you can leverage code generators that might come with it.

Run `nx list` to get a list of available plugins and whether they have generators. Then run `nx list <plugin-name>` to see what generators are available.

Learn more about [Nx generators on the docs](https://nx.dev/features/generate-code).

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks).


## Want better Editor Integration?

Have a look at the [Nx Console extensions](https://nx.dev/nx-console). It provides autocomplete support, a UI for exploring and running tasks & generators, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and comes with a LSP for Vim users.

## Explore the Project Graph
Run `nx graph` to show the graph of the workspace.
It will show tasks that you can run with Nx.
